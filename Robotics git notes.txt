Robotics Notes: 
	If there are any changes to Code use git hib with these steps:
		git add ., 
		git commit -m "your messege for what you are adding"
		git push

	To set up the repository(if you dont have a project already):
		set up a file to easly to place the clone into.
		Open git bash and put git clone then the url from git hub.
		then make an empty project in eclips and import the clone into the empty project.
		then go to the file in workspace or where ever all eclips files are saved and open git bash in the project
		put git inint.
		git status to check if it has worked
		you should be good after that.

	If you have a project that you have been working in or it has not wrked with git hub then just make a new one by 
	folowing the steps from above and then jsut move the code you have into the one that works that you jsut created.
